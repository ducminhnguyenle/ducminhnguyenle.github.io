## Guides

- This is a collection of guides and resources that I have found useful in my work.
- The guides are organized by topic, and each guide includes a brief description of the topic and a list of resources.
- The guides are not exhaustive, but they are a good starting point for learning about the topic.
- The guides are not meant to be a substitute for formal education or training, but they can be a helpful supplement to your learning.
